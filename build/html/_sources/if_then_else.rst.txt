Conditional Statements
**********************
Conditional statement are used as a way to direct the way things operate. For example, if I say "Please go to the store to
buy milk. If they don't have milk then buy apple juice".

Notice how If there isn't milk then we buy apple juice. However if there IS milk then we buy milk. This type of conditional statements
are ordered like this in PBasic:

::
        IF (*condition*) THEN
            *statement(s)*
