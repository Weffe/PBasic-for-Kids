Comments in PBasic
******************

Comments in PBasic are ignored when the program runs. Think of it as a way to make notes of what your program
does at certain situations so you can remember later. In PBasic, the way comments
are denoted is by using the apostrophe symbol: **'**

For example:
::
        ' This is a comment!

        DEBUG "Hello World!"

        ' Another comment!!!
