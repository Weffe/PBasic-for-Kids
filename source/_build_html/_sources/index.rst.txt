    Getting Started

Welcome to PBasic for Kids!
***************************
This is a beginner's guide for getting started on PBasic_ which is a programming language created by Parralax_ as an
easy way to interact with their various robots. For new beginners it can be a little hard to grasp various concepts of programming but
PBasic does a good job at being a language to power the robots while still being user friendly.
